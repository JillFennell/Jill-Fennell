### Importing Data
How I initially import data to begin a project is demonstrated [here](imports.md)


### Cleaning data
After importing data, it needs to be cleaned! The cleaning can be seen [here](Several ways to clean data.md.webarchive)


### Working with NumPy arrays
Throughout this semester I've become used to working with 2D Numpy Arrays. [Here](NumPyarraysportfolio.md.webarchive) is an example!

### Manipulating Data
I am able to manipulate data in several ways, shown [here](Manipulating data.md.webarchive) 

### Visualizing Data
There are several ways to visualize data, here are some [examples](https://github.com/JillFennell/Portfolio-2/blob/main/Data%20visualization.md.webarchive)
